# Animated Text with GSAP

This project animates text using JavaScript and GSAP. It splits the text into individual characters, including spaces, ensuring proper animations while preserving spacing.

## Features
- Splits text into individual characters for animation
- Preserves spaces between words
- Uses GSAP for smooth animations
- Adjustable animation delays and effects

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

## How It Works
1. The `breakTheText` function splits the text content of an `<h1>` element into individual characters.
2. Spaces are explicitly handled to ensure visibility during animation.
3. GSAP is used to animate the characters with different effects.
